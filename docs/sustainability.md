# Sustainability

**Supporting the development and maintenance of DazzleLib**

---

## Why Support DazzleLib?

DazzleLib is part of the [DazzleProj](https://github.com/DazzleProj) ecosystem - a collection of open-source Python libraries and tools that save developers significant time and effort.

**Current sponsorship: $0/month | Goal: $1,000/month**

---

## Value Proposition

If you're using DazzleLib in commercial projects, these libraries save you weeks of development time:

- **Time savings**: At $100/hour × 40 hours = **$4,000+ in value**
- **Cost-effective**: Contributing $25-100/month is a fraction of that value
- **Ongoing maintenance**: Your support ensures continued development and bug fixes
- **Quality assurance**: Funding allows for comprehensive testing and documentation
